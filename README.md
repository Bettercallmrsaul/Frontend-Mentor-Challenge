# About Me
Hi everyone. I am a newbie at everything involving coding. I currently just finished my CSS course on codeacademy and I am trying to
improve my skills in both HTML and CSS before I move onto the next language (JavaScript). This readme is about my current challenge on 
frontend mentor. It's the level 1 challenge called Results Summary Component.
